# Auto-Clicker-v1 
This was a small project of mine for a starting project with the help of some AI training and research I managed to make a small autoclicker that was good for my needs. 

I made this so i did not need to install a random auto clicker online.

## To Use
Clone the Repository or find it in the releases named ```Python Auto Clicker V1```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/W1nyx/Auto-Clicker-v1.git
```

Install ```pynput``` & ```keyboard```

```bash
pip install pynput keyboard
```
Run the script (Make sure you are in the right directory)

```bash
python AutoClicker.py
```

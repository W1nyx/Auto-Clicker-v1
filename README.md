# Auto-Clicker-v1 
This was a small project of mine for a starting project with the help of some AI training and research I managed to make a small autoclicker that was good for my needs. 

I made this so i did not need to install a random auto clicker online.

## To Intall
Clone the Repository or find it in the releases named ```Python Auto Clicker V1```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/W1nyx/Auto-Clicker-v1.git
```

Install ```pynput``` & ```keyboard```

```bash
pip install pynput keyboard
```
Run the script (Make sure you are in the right directory)

```bash
python AutoClicker.py
```
---
## To use

Once you run the script a python gui will appear with a few buttons

-  Clicks Per Second - This will control the ammount of clicks per second.

-  Mouse Button - This will let you chose to either use Left or Rigt click.

- Satus - This displays if the autoclicker is running or not.

Once you press F6 it will start the autoclicker or will stop it depending if it is on or not.
